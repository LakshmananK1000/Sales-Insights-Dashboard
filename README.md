# Sales Insights Dashboard

## Overview
The Sales Insights Dashboard project extracts and analyzes company sales data, customer locations, product details, total sales, and total quantity sold from a SQL database. The data is processed using Power Query in Power BI, modeled into a star schema, and visualized to provide actionable insights for the sales team.

## Purpose
The major goal of this project is to unlock sales insights previously hidden from the sales team, enabling data-driven decision support. The automated dashboard reduces manual data gathering efforts, providing quick and up-to-date sales insights.

## Success Criteria
- Enable the sales team to make better decisions resulting in a 10% cost savings of total spend.
